\section{Introduction}
Self-driving technologies had been used in airplanes (known 
as AP for Auto Pilot), and trains (known as ATO for Automatic 
Train Operation) for many years. However, as the road traffic
is far more complex, self-driving cars had never been in 
actual use. Thanks to the development of Machine Learning 
and Computer Vision, self-driving cars does not seem to be 
impossible nowadays. Thus, we would like to design a 
self-driving assistant program in the computer simulation 
environment.

The best performed models were chosen for this project to 
achieve the best performance.

\subsection{Containerization}
Containerization has been widely used in many industries. 
Compare to traditional virtual machine, the performance 
and resources loss are reduced to a large extent benefits 
from removing the guest OS and hardware virtualization. 
Docker, as the most popular container platform, are used here
in this project to containerlize our algorithm so that
