\section{Introduction}
Self-driving technologies had been used in airplanes (known 
as AP for Auto Pilot), and trains (known as ATO for 
Automatic Train Operation) for decades. However, as the 
road traffic is far more complex, self-driving cars have 
never been in commerical use. Thanks to the development of 
Machine Learning, Computer Vision and most importantly the 
hardwares, self-driving cars does not seem to be impossible 
today. Thus, we designed a self-driving assistant program 
in the computer simulation environment. 

The best performed models were chosen for this project to 
achieve the best performance. 

\section{Local Process}
\subsection{Screenshot}
Taking a screenshot can be harder than it looks. 
ImageGrab.grab() from PIL is a good approach. However, 
it costs 300-400ms to take a single screenshot which is 
obviously unacceptable. We test many different functions 
from different package, as a result, Python-MSS is much 
faster than any other package in the comparison with a 
average speed of 60fps, and was used at last.

\subsection{Encode \& Decode}
As we are using message queue as our message-oriented 
middleware, we must encode(serialize) the image prior to 
transimission and decode(deserialize) upon receive message. 
We tried three different ways to encode our image, JSON, 
pickle, and imencode. 

JSON is widely used in message queue, however, as ndarray 
used for image cannot be directly convert to JSON, we have 
to serialize the image first. Multiple attempts had been 
made, we succeed to encode image in milliseconds at last, 
unfortunately, we could not decode the image fast enough 
and we had to abandon JSON. 

Directly pack the image using pickle can be another method, 
we tried cPickle here instead for better performance. The 
encode and decode speed is the best among all methods, 
however, the size of the message is also several times 
larger than the size of the image. Messages of this size 
would place a heavy burden on the network, and was finally 
deprecated. 

The Joint Photographic Experts Group issued a synonym 
standard for still pictures compression in 1992, after 
27 years, the JPEG algorithm had became the most commonly 
used algorithm in image compression on this planet. OpenCV 
provides a built-in fucntion, i.e. imencode, which can 
convert a image from ndarray to byte stream within 
milliseconds. And more importantly, thanks to JPEG 
algorithm, the size of message is also ideal.

\subsection{Containerization}
Containerization has been widely used in many industries. 
Compare to traditional virtual machine, the performance 
and resources loss are reduced to a large extent benefits 
from removing the guest OS and hardware virtualization. 
Docker, as the most popular container platform, are used here
in this project to containerlize our algorithm so that
